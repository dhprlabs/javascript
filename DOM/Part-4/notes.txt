# so, here i have created an unordered list. 
  i have listed 2 languages in it.
  now, let's add a new list item in the list.

# to add an item to the list, we will create a function.
  after that, using querySelector, we will append it in our list.

# now, i will write an optimized version of what i just did before.

# let's say i want to select second list item and edit it.
  i will now write a function for that.
  i will use replaceWith() in order to edit the element.
  another way to edit is to use outerHTML in which we need to provide it 
  the whole html.

# at last if i want to remove an element, i will use the remove().
