## Variables 

- There are 3 types of variables: let, const and var. 

- It is prefer to use let and const instead of var. 
 
- The reason is in early javascript of there was issue of block scope & functional scope.

- So, you can use the var declared variable inside and outside of the function which was a major issue.
