# 🚀 JavaScript Tutorials

Welcome to my **JavaScript Tutorials** learning journey!  
This repository is a collection of my daily practice, projects, and notes as I learn JavaScript from scratch.

📚 I’m following tutorials and challenges from various YouTube creators and documenting everything here for reference and revision. This repo might help you too if you're just getting started with JavaScript!
