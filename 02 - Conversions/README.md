## Conversions

- It is important to know what value will the variable get if you try to convert it to other datatype.

- Assume, you have to convert a `String` into an `Integer`. 

- For example, I have `"33"` and I want to convert it into `Integer`, then will `"33"` will have the same value during conversion of will it have some other value.

- In the code, I have converted every other datatype to `Integer` to see what are the results.

- You can try some more conversions also.
