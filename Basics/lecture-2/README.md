## Datatypes 

- There are following datatypes: String, Number, Object, Boolean, BigInt, Symbol, Undefined and Null.

- Some important `typeof` to remember: 

```js
let state;  // undefined
let z = null;  // object
```

- There are mainly 2 classification of datatypes : primitive and non-primitive

- Primitive => String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt, Null and Undefined.

- Non-Primitive => Array, Objects and Functions.   

- All non-primitve datatypes are of `object` datatype.
