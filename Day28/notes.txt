# so, our first task is to extract the data from the parent div.
# i will make a script tag and write the dom logic there.

# there is an important property in our querySelector() which is children.
# second i have applied a for loop in order to print the content in every element.

# there are also properties like firstElementChild, lastElementChild.

# if we have used a querySelector() for an element and we want its parent element, then 
  it is not good to used it again. instead we should use the built-in property.

# there is a important property called childNodes.
  it is the tree that js makes.
  it is the base in react js where all the manipulations happen.
  it include a line break, comment, etc. as a new child.

--- two.html ---

# i will create a div element using document.createElement() in the script tag.
# i will give some more properties to it. check two.html file for it.

# there is a debate on how to add text in an element.
  if i use innerHTML then, it will take a round trip to implement it.
  if i use the createTextNode() then, i need to write two statements.
  this debate is among the developers, how work on optimization.

# now, i will append the element i created in the body section.
  if i do not write this statement, then our created element will not be visibe
  on our webpage. it will only remain in the memory.

# now, atlast i can create a function which creates a div element.
  also, i can add various parameters in that function.
