### Javascript and Classes

- Javascirpt does and doesn't have classes
- It is prototype based language

### OOP 

- Oject Oriented Programming
- Not a requirement
- Just a way in which code is structed 
- There are procedural & functional types also

### Why OOP ? 

- Code was getting messy
- Spaghetti code 
- So, to structure the code OOP was used

### Objects 

- Collection of methods and properties

### Object literal

- It means literally one object {}

### Some other topics 

- Prototypes
- Constructor function
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

### 4 Pillars of OOP

- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance

### Classes

- Classes in javascript were introduced from ES6
- Syntax is same as any other language
- There is constructor, methods, etc.

### Behind the scene code

- Remember the prototype in function
- Functions are objects only
- So, we can make a function first
- Then, add some methods in prototype 

### Inheritance 

- Using other class properties and methods
- Parent and child concept

### Static methods

- Some methods are bound to be used to system only
- No instance of a class should be allowed to use it
