## Variables 

- There are 3 types of variables: let, const and var. 

- It is prefer to use let and const instead of var. 
 
- The reason is in early javascript of there was issue of block scope & functional scope.

- So, you can use the var declared variable inside and outside of the function which was a major issue.

## Variable Types 

- There are following datatypes: String, Number, Object, Boolean, BigInt, Symbol, Undefined and Null.

- There are mainly 2 classification of datatypes : primitive and non-primitive

- Primitive => String, Number, Boolean, Symbol, BigInt, Null and Undefined.

- Non-Primitive => Array, Objects and Functions.   

- All non-primitve datatypes are of `object` datatype.
