## JavaScript Tutorials

Welcome to my **JavaScript learning journey!**

This repository is where I’m documenting everything I learn as I explore the world of JavaScript. Whether you're a fellow beginner, someone revisiting the language, or just curious about how JavaScript works, I hope this collection of notes, code snippets, and mini-projects can help you too.

## About This Repository

I'm learning JavaScript from the ground up by following tutorials, coding challenges, and video lessons from various YouTube channels and online resources. Each day, I aim to learn something new and apply it through practical coding.

Instead of just reading or watching content passively, I focus on writing code, making mistakes, and learning through doing. Everything I learn is tracked here for future reference and revision.

## Learning Plan

### Objective

- Build a strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and core concepts.
- Get comfortable writing JavaScript code through daily practice.
- Work on small projects to apply what I’ve learned in real-world scenarios.

### How It’s Organized

- The repository is organized by day (e.g., `Day 01`, `Day 02`, etc.).
- Each folder includes:
  - JavaScript code from that day's practice or lesson
  - Notes summarizing key concepts
  - Optional mini-projects or exercises to reinforce learning

## Why I’m Doing This

Learning JavaScript can be challenging at first, especially with so much information out there. By creating this public repository, I’m holding myself accountable and also building a resource that others might find useful. I believe that consistency and practice are key, and this repo helps me stay on track.
