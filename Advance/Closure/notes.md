### Lexical scoping

- When we declare a variable inside a function, all the functions inside that function are able to access it
- Variables of child functions are not accessible to parent function and any sibling function

### Closure 

- When we call a function in which we have returned a child function, along with the child function, the lexical scope of the parent function will be returned
